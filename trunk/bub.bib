     abstract = {A new method is presented for flexible regression modeling of high dimensional data. The model takes the form of an expansion in product spline basis functions, where the number of basis functions as well as the parameters associated with each one (product degree and knot locations) are automatically determined by the data. This procedure is motivated by the recursive partitioning approach to regression and shares its attractive properties. Unlike recursive partitioning, however, this method produces continuous models with continuous derivatives. It has more power and flexibility to model relationships that are nearly additive or involve interactions in at most a few variables. In addition, the model can be represented in a form that separately identifies the additive contributions and those associated with the different multivariable interactions.},

Its world-class authors provide guidance on all aspects of {B}ayesian data analysis and include examples of real statistical analyses, based on their own research, that demonstrate how to solve complicated problems. Changes in the new edition include: \Â·Stronger focus on MCMC\Â·Revision of the computational advice in Part III\Â·New chapters on nonlinear models and decision analysis\Â·Several additional applied examples from the authors' recent research\Â·Additional chapters on current models for {B}ayesian data analysis such as nonlinear models, generalized linear mixed models, and more\Â·Reorganization of chapters 6 and 7 on model checking and data collection{B}ayesian computation is currently at a stage where there are many reasonable 
ways to compute any given posterior distribution. However, the best approach is not always clear ahead of time. Reflecting this, the new edition offers a more pluralistic presentation, giving advice on performing computations from many perspectives while making clear the importance of being aware that there are different ways to implement any given iterative simulation computation. The new approach, additional examples, and updated information make {B}ayesian Data Analysis an excellent introductory text and a reference that working scientists will use throughout their professional life.}},

In this problem-oriented introduction to the field, Herbert Gintis exposes students to the techniques and applications of game theory through a wealth of sophisticated and surprisingly fun-to-solve problems involving human (and even animal) behavior.</p><p><i>Game Theory Evolving</i> is innovative in several ways. First, it reflects game theory's expansion into such areas as cooperation in teams, networks, the evolution and diffusion of preferences, the connection between biology and economics, artificial life simulations, and experimental economics. Second, the book--recognizing that students learn by doing and that most game theory texts are weak on problems--is organized around problems, and introduces principles through practice. Finally, the quality of the problems is simply unsurpassed, and each chapter 
provides a study plan for instructors interested in teaching evolutionary game theory.</p><p>Reflecting the growing consensus that in many important contexts outside of anonymous markets, human behavior is not well described by classical 'rationality,' Gintis shows students how to apply game theory to model how people behave in ways that reflect the special nature of human sociality and individuality. This book is perfect for upper undergraduate and graduate economics courses as well as a terrific introduction for ambitious do-it-yourselfers throughout the behavioral sciences.</p>}},

@article{Epstein,
	abstract = {This article argues that the agent-based computational model permits a distinctive approach to social science for which the term ?generative? is suitable. In defending this terminology, features distinguishing the approach from both ?inductive? and ?deductive? science are given. Then, the following specific contributions to social science are discussed: The agent-based computational model is a new tool for empirical research. It offers a natural environment for the study of connectionist phenomena in social science. Agent-based modeling provides a powerful way to address certain enduring - and especially interdisciplinary - questions. It allows one to subject certain core theories - such as neoclassical microeconomics - to important types of stress (e.g., the effect of evolving preferences). It permits one to study how rules of individual behavior give rise - or ?map up? - to macroscopic regularities and organizations. In turn, one can employ laboratory behavioral research findings to select 
among competing agent-based (?bottom up?) models. The agent-based approach may well have the important effect of decoupling individual rationality from macroscopic equilibrium and of separating decision science from social science more generally. Agent-based modeling offers powerful new forms of hybrid theoretical-computational work; these are particularly relevant to the study of non-equilibrium systems. The agent-based approach invites the interpretation of society as a distributed computational device, and in turn the interpretation of social dynamics as a type of computation. This interpretation raises important foundational issues in social science - some related to intractability, and some to undecidability proper. Finally, since ?emergence? figures prominently in this literature, I take up the connection between agent-based modeling and classical emergentism, criticizing the latter and arguing that the two are incompatible.

Our motivating scenario is the need to provide situational awareness support to first responders at the scene of a large scale incident, and to this end, we describe a novel iterative formulation of a multi-output Gaussian process that can build and exploit a probabilistic model of the environmental variables being measured (including the correlations and delays that exist between them). We validate our approach using data collected from a network of weather sensors located on the south coast 
of England.}

@misc{WolpertInfTheory,
	abstract = {A long-running difficulty with conventional game theory has been how to
modify it to accommodate the bounded rationality of all real-world players. A
recurring issue in statistical physics is how best to approximate joint
probability distributions with decoupled (and therefore far more tractable)
distributions. This paper shows that the same information theoretic
mathematical structure, known as Product Distribution (PD) theory, addresses
both issues. In this, PD theory not only provides a principled formulation of
bounded rationality and a set of new types of mean field theory in statistical
physics. It also shows that those topics are fundamentally one and the same.},

@misc{YoussefExotic,

consistency with the basic {B}ayesian framework. This modification results in
copies of standard probability theory for real, complex or quaternion
probabilities. These copies, in turn, allow one to derive quantum theory while
restoring standard probability theory in the classical limit. The argument
leading to these three copies constrain physical theories in the same sense
that Cox's original arguments constrain alternatives to standard probability
theory. This sequence is presented in some detail with emphasis on questions
beyond basic quantum theory where new insights are needed.},
